## Description

Robofriends is an exercise and project from the web development courses of [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/). The app fetches user data from JSON Placeholder, which is then used to fetch data from [Robohash](https://robohash.org), namely as it says, "unique images from any text". These images and the user data are displayed as cards in a gallery and can be filtered using the search bar.

If using this project for reference, the code is structured using classes. Refer to [Robofriends-func](https://github.com/SmKou/robofriends-func) for code structured using functions.
